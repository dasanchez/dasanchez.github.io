### [Kindred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)) - Octavia E. Butler

**Do you honestly believe you traveled back over a century in time and crossed three thousand miles of space to see your dead ancestors?**

Every time I watch [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)) I think to myself "boy am I glad I don't have to travel in time to the past" due in part to my brownness, and because more than a couple of centuries in, the whole affair seems rather unhealthy.  
Not only does Dana, a black woman, suffer from sudden time travel disorder, she also lands in the same slave plantation every single time. It was a thrilling read all the way through. I'm impressed it hasn't been made into a movie or TV show at this point.
