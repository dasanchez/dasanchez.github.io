### [The Man in the High Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) - Philip K. Dick

**A psychotic world we live in. The madmen are in power. How long have we known this? Faced this? And--how many of us do know it? Perhaps if you know you are insane then you are not insane. Or you are becoming sane, finally. Waking up. I suppose only a few are aware of all this. Isolated persons here and there. But the broad masses...what do they think? All these hundreds of thousands in this city, here. Do they imagine that they live in a sane world? Or do they guess, glimpse, the truth...?**

A parallel universe in which the Axis won WWII and split the US territory between Japan- and Germany-controlled territories. The ending left me unsatisfied, and I found out Philip K. Dick had meant to write a sequel eventually. Oh well. I enjoyed the way he made the Japanese grammar come through to English in all dialogue and first-person narration.
