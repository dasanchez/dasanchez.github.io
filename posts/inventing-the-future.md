### [Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work) - Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams

**In many circles resistance has come to be glorified, obscuring the conservative nature of such a stance behind a veil of radical rhetoric. Resistance is seen to be all that is possible, while constructive projects are nothing but a dream. While it can be important in some circumstances, in the task of building a new world, resistance is futile.**

...

**...it has been collective investment, not private investment, that has been the primary driver of technological development. High-risk inventions and new technologies are too risky for private capitalists to invest in; figures such as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk slyly obscure their parasitical reliance on state-led developments. Likewise, multi-billion dollar megascale projects are ultimately drien by non-economic goals that exceed any cost-benefit analysis.**

I connected with the text so much, I had to share two exercpts :)

The authors present a few ideas on how to build a leftist platform to successfully rival the neoliberal mindset driving today's global powers. They start by covering the rise of neoliberalism as a decades-long planned effort envisioned by the Mont Pelerin Society, and then move on to lay out a framework for how today's and tomorrow's left can build a sustainable movement.

The key takeaways for me are:
- Reclaim the concept of futurism as a chance to free ourselves from work, not as a way to accumulate wealth. The idea that we should be working towards 100% **un**employment (admittedly as a very long-term goal) brought a huge grin to my face.
- All disenfranchised groups should be brought into a tentpole that covers women, minority groups, immigrants, the working class, and environmentally endangered groups, just for starters. 

They present the current political climate with plenty of doom and gloom, but one of the futures they envision is as full of hope as AOC's [A Message From the Future video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ).

I highly suggest you give this a read to get some context on how we arrived at today's state of affairs in politics and economics.
