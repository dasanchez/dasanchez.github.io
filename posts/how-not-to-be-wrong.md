### [How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_to_Be_Wrong) - Jordan Ellenberg

**If you've ever used America's most popular sort-of-illegal psychotropic substance, you know what it feels like to have too-flat priors. Every single stimulus that greets you, no matter how ordinary, seems intensely meaningful. Each experience grabs hold of your attention and demands that you take notice. It's a very interesting mental state to be in. But it's not conducive to making good inferences.** 

Jordan Ellenberg covers several topics of mathematics and model thinking through colourful stories, diagrams, and great humour throughout. I only recently found out ranked ballots are a real thing in the world, so it was great to see a breakdown on different voting systems, using the Bush/Gore/Nader Florida ballot in the 2000 election as a case study.

It's the second book I've read in the past year that references Claude Shannon's _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_, so I will have to add that my list.
