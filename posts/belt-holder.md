# Build a Laser Cut Belt Holder

I have three belts and no dedicated space for them. I have been looking for a small project to use a laser cutter for, so I thought why not make myself a closet belt holder.

## Model

The idea is simple: a three-compartment holder that I can hang from a closet rod. Using Fusion 360, I put together a model that I can split up in multiple laser-cut layers.

Using this geometry, I only have two unique pieces: the two end panels, and all the middle ones that make up the main body. I also add holes throughout the panels so I can align all pieces with dowels when I assemble everything later on.

## Laser Cutting

Using Fusion 360, I can output a face or sketch to a DXF file. I export a DXF for each kind of panel.
In Inkscape, I import each DXF and assign a "hair-line" (0.025mm) width to all shapes.

I export two PDFs: one per panel type, each PDF with two copies of the same part.

I have a lot of unused 1/4" MDF from previous projects, so I go with wood for this project. Using the laser cutter at [Newmakeit](http://www.newmakeit.com), I cut ten middle panels and two end panels.

WIth the panels fresh off the laser cutter, I test fit the whole assembly using 1/8"-diameter dowels from Home Depot. I am now ready to glue everything together.

## Assembly

I glue the pieces together, two at a time, with Gorilla glue and clamps, as well as the dowels. I let the glue cure for at least a day before adding the next piece.

I was not very careful with the excess glue.

## Finishing: Sanding and Painting

WIth all the pieces glued together, I start the following process:

1. Dremel off excess glue
2. 100 grit sanding
3. 200 grit sanding
4. Gesso priming (round 1)
5. 200 grit sanding
6. Gesso priming (round 2)
7. White acrylic paint
8. Matte varnish

This turns out to be the longest part of the project: lots of elbow grease required!

## Completion

Once the varnish dries off, I hang the holder on the closet rod and fit my belts in it.

Success!

## Lessons learned

The glueing and finishing took a lot longer than I would have liked. Next time around I will make sure the geometry is as simple I can make it. In this case, the main body could have been replaced by a series of rods instead of full panels. This would have greatly decreased the amount of wasted unused MDF.
