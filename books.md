### [Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work) - Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams

**In many circles resistance has come to be glorified, obscuring the conservative nature of such a stance behind a veil of radical rhetoric. Resistance is seen to be all that is possible, while constructive projects are nothing but a dream. While it can be important in some circumstances, in the task of building a new world, resistance is futile.**

...

**...it has been collective investment, not private investment, that has been the primary driver of technological development. High-risk inventions and new technologies are too risky for private capitalists to invest in; figures such as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk slyly obscure their parasitical reliance on state-led developments. Likewise, multi-billion dollar megasccale projects are ultimately drien by non-economic goals that exceed any cost-benefit analysis.**

I connected with the text so much, I had to share two exercpts :)

The authors present a few ideas on how to build a leftist platform to successfully rival the neoliberal mindset driving today's global powers. They start by covering the rise of neoliberalism as a decades-long planned effort envisioned by the Mont Pelerin Society, and then move on to lay out a framework for how today's and tomorrow's left can build a sustainable movement.

The key takeaways for me are:
- Reclaim the concept of futurism as a chance to free ourselves from work, not as a way to accumulate wealth. The idea that we should be working towards 100% **un**employment (admittedly as a very long-term goal) brought a huge grin to my face.
- All disenfranchised groups should be brought into a tentpole that covers women, minority groups, immigrants, the working class, and environmentally endangered groups, just for starters. 

They present the current political climate with plenty of doom and gloom, but one of the futures they envision is as full of hope as AOC's [A Message From the Future video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ).

I highly suggest you give this a read to get some context on how we arrived at today's state of affairs in politics and economics.

### [After On](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563853/after-on-by-rob-reid/9781524798079/) - Rob Reid

**Some punk scenes are so hostile to mainstream norms that everyone ends up dressed and coiffed identically in the name of nonconformity. In tech, the ironies arise from rigidly specific codes of carefree informality. Dress standards can get so laid back that ties are ripped from the necks of hapless visitors, scissored in two and mounted on trophy walls that herald the company's militant easygoingness. Certain CEOs haughtily refuse any beer poured in a glass as an affront to their folsky habit of unpretentiously drinking straight from the bottle. And half of the local plutocrats seem to think the thinnest window-dressing will give them Guevara-grade lefty auras. Thus all the flat anti-hierarchies seeking to offset the founder's awkward membership in the top 0.001 percent by having him sit amidst the rabble at a desk protected by neither walls nor doors. You know, just like a regular schlub!**

I had a tough time picking a paragraph to quote from this book, there were so many good options!

A nascent AI gains consciousness as part of a OKCupid-like platform powered by a quantom computer. Tons of technobabble and Silicon Valley (the culture, not the TV show) references to geek out on and chuckle at. It reminded me a lot of [jPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPod_(TV_series)), down to the misguided AI looking to make friends within the tech company that birthed her! That show had so much potential.

Thanks [@ssoroka](https://twitter.com/ssoroka) for the recommendation!

### [How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_to_Be_Wrong) - Jordan Ellenberg

**If you've ever used America's most popular sort-of-illegal psychotropic substance, you know what it feels like to have too-flat priors. Every single stimulus that greets you, no matter how ordinary, seems intensely meaningful. Each experience grabs hold of your attention and demands that you take notice. It's a very interesting mental state to be in. But it's not conducive to making good inferences.** 

Jordan Ellenberg covers several topics of mathematics and model thinking through colourful stories, diagrams, and great humour throughout. I only recently found out ranked ballots are a real thing in the world, so it was great to see a breakdown on different voting systems, using the Bush/Gore/Nader Florida ballot in the 2000 election as a case study.

It's the second book I've read in the past year that references Claude Shannon's _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_, so I will have to add that my list.

### [Kindred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)) - Octavia Butler.

**Do you honestly believe you traveled back over a century in time and crossed three thousand miles of space to see your dead ancestors?**

Every time I watch [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)) I think to myself "boy am I glad I don't have to travel in time to the past" due in part to my brownness, and because more than a couple of centuries in, the whole affair seems rather unhealthy.  
Not only does Dana, a black woman, suffer from sudden time travel disorder, she also lands in the same slave plantation every single time. It was a thrilling read all the way through. I'm impressed it hasn't been made into a movie or TV show at this point.

### [The Man in the High Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) - Philip K. Dick

**A psychotic world we live in. The madmen are in power. How long have we known this? Faced this? And--how many of us do know it? Perhaps if you know you are insane then you are not insane. Or you are becoming sane, finally. Waking up. I suppose only a few are aware of all this. Isolated persons here and there. But the broad masses...what do they think? All these hundreds of thousands in this city, here. Do they imagine that they live in a sane world? Or do they guess, glimpse, the truth...?**

A parallel universe in which the Axis won WWII and split the US territory between Japan- and Germany-controlled territories. The ending left me unsatisfied, and I found out Philip K. Dick had meant to write a sequel eventually. Oh well. I enjoyed the way he made the Japanese grammar come through to English in all dialogue and first-person narration.

### [Diry Wars: The World is a Battlefield](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jeremy-scahill/dirty-wars/9781568587271/) - Jeremy Scahill

**On September 14, 2001, the House and Senate gave president Bush unprecedented latitude to wage a global war, passing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). It passed the House with only on opposing vote and the Senate with no dissent. The lone "Nay" vote against the AUMF came from liberal California Democrat Barbara Lee. "However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint," Lee declared, voice trembling, as she spoke on the floor of the House that day. "There must be some of us who say, let's step back for a moment and think through the implications of our actions today - let us more fully understand their consequences..."**

A sobering, decades-spanning chronicle of the rise of legalized death squads, drone strikes, and extraordinary renditions. Among many other things, it follows the lives of US citizens as they are labeled high value targets and hunted by their own government halfway across the world without due process. I'm glad there are journalists out there willing to share these stories.

If you haven't listened to the [Intercepted](https://theintercept.com/podcasts/) podcast, you should check it out.

### [A House in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House_in_the_Sky) - Amanda Lindhout & Sara Corbett

**In my mind, I built stairways. At the end of the stairways, I imagined rooms. These were high, airy places with big windows and a cool breeze moving through. I imagined one room opening brightly onto another room until I'd built a house, a place with hallways and more staircases. I built many houses, one after another, and those gave rise to a city - a calm, sparkling city neat the ocean, a place like Vancouver. I put myself there, and that's where I lived, in the wide-open sky of my mind. I made friends and a read books and went running on a footpath in a jewel-green park along the harbour. I ate pancakes drizzled in syrup and took baths and watched sunlight pout through trees. This wasn't longing, and it wasn't insanity. It was relief. It got me through.**

Amanda Lindhout takes you through her captivity under religious extremists and her efforts to keep her hope and sanity alive during her ordeal. For all the dark, horrible things she went through, this book tells the story of a woman who's not only brave and resilient, but compassionate and full of empathy for everyone around her. It was rather motivating, on the whole.

As she kept getting closer and closer to Somalia, I wanted to go back in time and yell at her "No! What do you think you're doing?! Go back home!"

### [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://chrishadfield.ca/books/) - Chris Hadfield

**The life of an astronaut is one of simulating, practicing and anticipating, trying to build the necessary skills and create the correct mind-set. But ultimately, it's all pretend.**

Chris Hadfield has great advice on how to approach work and life with the right attitude. It's a life story that covers the span of his career, including all three trips to space, with some great anecdotes thrown in to keep things lively. If you don't feel like reading the book, go and watch [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) at least.

### [Dark Matter (Audiobook)](http://blakecrouch.com/dark-matter.php) - Blake Crouch  
For a book about multiversal incursion shenaningans, the plot is actually quite straightforward.
