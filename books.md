## I have read (or listened to):

[A House in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House_in_the_Sky) - Amanda Lindhout & Sara Corbett  
_In my mind, I built stairways. At the end of the stairways, I imagined rooms. These were high, airy places with big windows and a cool breeze moving through. I imagined one room opening brightly onto another room until I'd built a house, a place with hallways and more staircases. I built many houses, one after another, and those gave rise to a city - a calm, sparkling city neat the ocean, a place like Vancouver. I put myself there, and that's where I lived, in the wide-open sky of my mind. I made friends and a read books and went running on a footpath in a jewel-green park along the harbour. I ate pancakes drizzled in syrup and took baths and watched sunlight pout through trees. This wasn't longing, and it wasn't insanity. It was relief. It got me through._

Amanda Lindhout takes you through her captivity under religious extremists and her efforts to keep her hope and sanity alive during her ordeal. For all the dark, horrible things she went through, this book tells the story of a woman who's not only brave and resilient, but compassionate and full of empathy for everyone around her. It was rather motivating, on the whole.

As she kept getting closer and closer to Somalia, I wanted to go back in time and yell at her "No! What do you think you're doing?! Go back home!" 

[An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://chrishadfield.ca/books/) - Chris Hadfield  
_The life of an astronaut is one of simulating, practicing and anticipating, trying to build the necessary skills and create the correct mind-set. But ultimately, it's all pretend._

Chris Hadfield has great advice on how to approach work and life with the right attitude. It's a life story that covers the span of his career, including all three trips to space, with some great anecdotes thrown in to keep things lively. If you don't feel like reading the book, go and watch [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) at least.

[Makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers_(novel)) - Cory Doctorow  
I also just want to build things all day.

[World War Z (Audiobook)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z) - Max Brooks  
I think I liked the movie better.

[Norse Mythology (Audiobook)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_Mythology_(Neil_Gaiman)) - Neil Gaiman  

[Dark Matter (Audiobook)](http://blakecrouch.com/dark-matter.php) - Blake Crouch  
For a book about multiversal incursion shenaningans, the plot is actually quite straightforward.
