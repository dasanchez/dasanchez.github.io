## I have read (or listened to):

[An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://chrishadfield.ca/books/) - Chris Hadfield  
_"The life of an astronaut is one of simulating, practicing and anticipating, trying to build the necessary skills and create the correct mind-set. But ultimately, it's all pretend."_

Chris Hadfield has great advice on how to approach work and life with the right attitude. It's a life story that covers the span of his career, including all three trips to space, with some great anecdotes thrown in to keep things lively. If you don't feel like reading the book, go and watch [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) at least.
