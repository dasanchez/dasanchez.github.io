## I have read (or listened to):

### [Kindred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)) - Octavia Butler.

_Do you honestly believe you traveled back over a century in time and crossed three thousand miles of space to see your dead ancestors?_

Every time I watch [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)) I think to myself "boy am I glad I don't have to travel in time to the past" due in part to my brownness, and because more than a couple of centuries in, the whole affair seems rather unhealthy.  
Not only does Dana, a black woman, suffer from sudden time travel disorder, she also lands in the same slave plantation every single time. It was a thrilling read all the way through. I'm impressed it hasn't been made into a movie or TV show at this point.

### [The Man in the High Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) - Philip K. Dick

_A psychotic world we live in. The madmen are in power. How long have we known this? Faced this? And--how many of us do know it? Perhaps if you know you are insane then you are not insane. Or you are becoming sane, finally. Waking up. I suppose only a few are aware of all this. Isolated persons here and there. But the broad masses...what do they think? All these hundreds of thousands in this city, here. Do they imagine that they live in a sane world? Or do they guess, glimpse, the truth...?_

A parallel universe in which the Axis won WWII and split the US territory between Japan- and Germany-controlled territories. The ending left me unsatisfied, and I found out Philip K. Dick had meant to write a sequel eventually. Oh well. I enjoyed the way he made the Japanese grammar come through to English in all dialogue and first-person narration.

### [Ancillary Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice) - Ann Leckie

_If you're going to do something that crazy, save it for when it'll make a difference._

A rogue centuries-old AI on a quest for justice and a wee bit of revenge.

### [Diry Wars: The World is a Battlefield](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jeremy-scahill/dirty-wars/9781568587271/) - Jeremy Scahill

_On September 14, 2001, the House and Senate gave president Bush unprecedented latitude to wage a global war, passing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). It passed the House with only on opposing vote and the Senate with no dissent. The lone "Nay" vote against the AUMF came from liberal California Democrat Barbara Lee. "However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint," Lee declared, voice trembling, as she spoke on the floor of the House that day. "There must be some of us who say, let's step back for a moment and think through the implications of our actions today - let us more fully understand their consequences..."_

A sobering, decades-spanning chronicle of the rise of legalized death squads, drone strikes, and extraordinary renditions. Among many other things, it follows the lives of US citizens as they are labeled high value targets and hunted by their own government halfway across the world without due process. I'm glad there are journalists out there willing to share these stories.

### [A House in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House_in_the_Sky) - Amanda Lindhout & Sara Corbett

_In my mind, I built stairways. At the end of the stairways, I imagined rooms. These were high, airy places with big windows and a cool breeze moving through. I imagined one room opening brightly onto another room until I'd built a house, a place with hallways and more staircases. I built many houses, one after another, and those gave rise to a city - a calm, sparkling city neat the ocean, a place like Vancouver. I put myself there, and that's where I lived, in the wide-open sky of my mind. I made friends and a read books and went running on a footpath in a jewel-green park along the harbour. I ate pancakes drizzled in syrup and took baths and watched sunlight pout through trees. This wasn't longing, and it wasn't insanity. It was relief. It got me through._

Amanda Lindhout takes you through her captivity under religious extremists and her efforts to keep her hope and sanity alive during her ordeal. For all the dark, horrible things she went through, this book tells the story of a woman who's not only brave and resilient, but compassionate and full of empathy for everyone around her. It was rather motivating, on the whole.

As she kept getting closer and closer to Somalia, I wanted to go back in time and yell at her "No! What do you think you're doing?! Go back home!"

### [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://chrishadfield.ca/books/) - Chris Hadfield

_The life of an astronaut is one of simulating, practicing and anticipating, trying to build the necessary skills and create the correct mind-set. But ultimately, it's all pretend._

Chris Hadfield has great advice on how to approach work and life with the right attitude. It's a life story that covers the span of his career, including all three trips to space, with some great anecdotes thrown in to keep things lively. If you don't feel like reading the book, go and watch [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) at least.
